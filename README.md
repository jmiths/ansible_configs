# Redacted Ansible Configurations from a Position at Scale

Brief Introduction:
- Ansible runs a series of tasks
- Each task can be encompassed into a role
- Each playbook runs many roles
- Ansible runs commands with error checking
- It can either put dynamic files in place with templates or just static files
- Ansible also has lots of variables available at the group, host or role level. This allows for a very granular hierarchy

This particular set of configurations managed in between 200 and 300 hosts every day.  This project has been heavily redacted to protect sensitive information and thus large parts are missing.
